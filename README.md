# Educase Design

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository (or download the source code).
2.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3.  Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
